###### How to run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Programmer-from-MARS/fractol.git
cd fractol
make
./fractol
```
##### Once you run my programm you will see menu where you can chose which fractol you want see and play with!

3. ***When you press "J" you will see Julia fractal. The most cool thing about that fractal is that you can change fractol by moving your mouse and one you click your mouse once again it will freeze in its current state.***

## About my code:
Using MinilibX library my program generets new images pixel by pixel for each fractol you chosen. Then it pushes that image to the screen as well as helping menu I have created in advance.
